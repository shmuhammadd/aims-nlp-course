#  **Introduction to NLP â€“ Course Overview**  

Welcome to the **Introduction to NLP** course! Over the next **3 weeks**, weâ€™ll take a deep dive into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**â€”from fundamental text processing techniques to cutting-edge **deep learning models like transformers**.  

This course is designed for **beginners and intermediate learners** who want to build a solid understanding of NLP, gain **hands-on experience**, and work with **real-world applications**.  

By the end of this course, you will be able to:  
âœ… Understand the **NLP pipeline** and essential text processing techniques  
âœ… Implement **statistical and deep learning-based NLP models**  
âœ… Work with **word embeddings, transformers, and transfer learning**  
âœ… Use **PyTorch & Hugging Face** to build state-of-the-art NLP applications  
âœ… Learn about **ethical considerations in NLP** and the **future of AI models**
